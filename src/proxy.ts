/**
 * Next.js Proxy (formerly Middleware) - the first, cheap gate for the admin
 * console. A visitor with no sign of a session is redirected to /login before
 * the admin bundle is ever sent.
 *
 * Two cookies count as "sign of a session":
 *  - `refreshToken` — the real httpOnly session cookie, visible here only when
 *    the API shares this site's domain (local dev, same-domain deploys).
 *  - `kk.auth.hint` — a first-party presence hint the client sets on login and
 *    clears on logout, for production where the API lives on another origin
 *    and its cookies never reach this proxy.
 *
 * The gate is deliberately one-directional and presence-only. A *present*
 * cookie is NOT proof of a live session (it can be stale — e.g. a reset DB), so
 * we must NOT also redirect cookie-bearing visitors away from /login: that would
 * fight `RequireAuth`, which does the real `GET /auth/me` validation and, on
 * failure, clears the cookie and returns to /login. Bouncing both ways on cookie
 * presence loops. So /login is left alone here and RequireAuth is the authority.
